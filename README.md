# OptiFine Versions

An archive of all existing versions of OptiFine from [here](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1286605-b1-4-1-9-optifine-history)

Downloaded, saved sums, and uploaded all in one video [here](https://youtu.be/gZH11_sRQLo) so you know they're not modified

I recommend downloading them from the official source if still available, but I made this for the future when they don't exist

These are only versions that were removed from the website for having Minecraft code in them
